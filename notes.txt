- architecture (methods)
    - [FIGURE] architecture diagram [DONE?]
    - demonstrates scalability
    - highlights that only janis provides certain translation
        - galaxy -> nextflow
        - galaxy -> wdl
        - wdl -> nextflow

- sample input -> output (methods)
    - [FIGURE] full tool translation (simple, from CWL) [TODO]
    - [FIGURE] full workflow translation (simple, from Galaxy) [TODO]
    - displays janis basic functionality and expected output

- feature snippets (methods)
    - [FIGURE] feature snippets [TODO]
    - datatypes, inputs, outputs, prefix, subworkflows etc etc
    - displays janis extended functionality and expected output

- galaxy parsing (methods)
    - [FIGURE] annotated galaxy wrapper [TODO]
    - demonstrates our approach to parsing galaxy
    - not a lexer, progressive evidence gathering approach
    - high-confidence evidence used to identify CLI args, followed by low-confidence evidence

- feature coverage (results)
    - [TABLE] basic feature coverage (ingest) [TODO]
    - [TABLE] extensive feature coverage (ingest) [TODO]
        - sample of 10 workflows for each format
        - which feature is used and in what quantity
        - which of these does janis currently support
    - demonstrates supported / unsupported features
    - gives people measure of whether janis can handle their tool / workflow 

- translator metrics (results)
    - [TABLE] Janis vs (cwl2nxf, galaxy2cwl, cwl2wdl, wdl2cwl) table [TODO]
    - displays janis vs others runnability
    - logic similarity, syntax similarity?, runnability

- translator outputs (results)
    - [FIGURE x4] Janis vs (cwl2nxf, galaxy2cwl, cwl2wdl, wdl2cwl) [TODO]
    - displays janis vs others readability

Issue? 
- must do `pip install -e ../janis-core`


artificial tool tests
